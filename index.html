            <br></br>
            Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
             Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
             <br></br>
It currently supports hundreds of programming languages and file formats.
 Several common languages come supported by default (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc), and others gain support by adding integrated extensions.
  If you find a language that isn't supported by an existing extension, the open nature of the extensions system means you can build one.
  <br></br>
  How to set it up
  <br></br>
  Step 1: Download Visual studio code.
  <br></br>
Step 2: Install vscode
This step is easy, accept the agreement and click next.
<br></br>
Step 3: Download extensions for visual studio code.
Once you have installed visual studio code, now its time to install some extensions.
 Click on the button where red arrow is pointing in above image.
Now click on C/C++ extension from Microsoft as shown in the below image.
 If you don't see the extension search C/C++ and you will find it.
 Now we have successfully installed code editor but we need a compiler to compile and output our code, for that we will be installing MinGW.
 <br></br>
 Step 4: Download MinGW
 <br></br>
 Step 5: Install MinGW
Open the installer, you should see something like the below image.
 Click on install and choose your directory where the software should be installed and click continue.
 After installing, click on continue and right click on every checkbox and choose mark for installation.
 Now click Installation on top left corner and then choose Apply Changes.
 <br></br>
 Step 6: Copy Bin Path
Now open 'This PC' and open 'local Disk C' you should see mingw file and click on bin folder.
<br></br>
Step 7: Environment Variables
Open 'Control Panel' from your start menu and click on System.
If you don't find system on your control panel just type 'system' on the search bar which you can find in top right corner of the control panel.
<br></br>
Step 8: Let's check if MinGW has been successfully installed or not.
Click on search button near the bottom left of windows and search for command prompt.
ðŸ›‘ ðŸ›‘ If you get some error don't worry just reinstall mingw as shown in the step 4 and step 5 and it should solve the problem.ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘
<br></br>
step 8: Let's write our first program in C++
Hurray! we have successfully set up vscode for C and C++ now lets test it by writing our first program in vscode.

To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows).

As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. 
Click the "Console" tab in that window.
<br></br>
You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript.
 The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console.
  To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.
